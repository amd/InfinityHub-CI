# PETSc

## Overview
PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation, pronounced PET-see (the S is silent), is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations. It supports MPI, and GPUs through CUDA, HIP or OpenCL, as well as hybrid MPI-GPU parallelism; it also supports the NEC-SX Tsubasa Vector Engine. PETSc (sometimes called PETSc/TAO) also contains the TAO, the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization, software library.

## Building Recipes
[Docker/Singularity Build](/petsc/docker/)

## Running PETSc Benchmark
A 3D Poisson Solve is included with the source code and is designed to assess the performance characteristics of PETSc library. As of now, the benchmark can be located in the `src/ksp/ksp/tutorials/` directory, within the [PETSc GIT repository](). This Script [run-benchmark.sh](/petsc/docker/benchmark/run-benchmark.sh) can be used to build and run the benchmark. It is included in the [PETSc Docker image](/petsc/docker/).

For the `run-benchmark.sh` bash script included here, the usage can be found by adding the `-h` which prints the different arguments that can be passed to the script. For example:

```
./run-benchmark.sh -h
```
will print the usage as: 
```
This script is designed to setup and run PETSc ksp_performance (3D Poisson Solve) benchmark on GPUs.
=================================
usage: ./run-benchmark.sh

       -h | --help      Prints the usage
       -c | --clean     Clean the case directory
       -r | --run-only  skip build, and directly run the benchmark
       -g | --ngpus     #GPUs to be used (between 1-10), defaults to 1
       -d | --gpu-support support for GPU offloading (e.g.: HIP or CUDA)
       -l | --log-view  Enables -log_view to see more details at end of PETSc solve
       -n | --mat-size  Prescribe a Mat size (e.g -n 200 will select a 200^3 matrix)
       -pc| --pc-type   Prescribe custom options for preconditioner
                        (default -pc_type bjacobi and -sub_pc_type ilu)
       -ksp|--ksp-options Prescribe custom options for KSP solvers
```
The `run-benchmark.sh` script configures and sets some parameters to run the PETSc benchmark (`bench_kspsolve`) on GPUs. A description of these parameters is included below for reference: 

| parameters| description/options   |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| -vec_type | type of backend (CPU/GPU) for **vec** class. <br> Options: <br> `seq` for single CPU-only, `mpi` for multiple-CPU <br> `hip` for single or multiple AMD GPUs with HIP <br> Similar `cuda`, `kokkos` available for CUDA and Kokkos.|
| -mat_type | type of backend (CPU/GPU) for **mat** class. <br> Options: <br> `aij` for single CPU-only, `mpiaij` for multiple-CPU <br> `aijhipsparse` for single or multiple AMD GPUs with HIP <br> Similar `aijcusparse`, `aijkokkos` available for CUDA and Kokkos.|
| -pc_type  | preconditioner type. E.g. `ilu`, `gamg`, etc. |
| -ksp_type | Krylov subspace method type. E.g. `cg`, `gmres`, etc. |

A full list of tuneable parameters and configurations can be found in PETSc [documentation](https://petsc.org/release/docs/manual/).

To run the benchmark on 1 GPU using the bash script, use the command:
```
./run-benchmark.sh -g 1
```
> NOTE
> * If the `-g` is not mentioned in commands above, by default the script will use 1 GPU. But for consistency, we recommend always adding the `-g` to prescribe #GPUs.
> * The number of GPUs can be altered to run on multiple GPUs. When #GPUs>1, the number of MPI ranks used will be equal to the number of GPUs. For example, when launched with 4 GPUs, 4 MPI ranks will be deployed. The script will automatically  adjust the MPI ranks to the number of GPUs.
> * It must be noted that the script is designed to run on a maximum of 10 GPUs at a time, and will require alteration if #GPUs>10 need to be used. One can also assign multiple-MPI ranks to each GPU, however that is not included in these bash scripts.
> * Problem size is define by the cube dimension, which can be varied using the `-n` option. By default the script uses `-n 200`, but a customized dimension can be provided with:
> ```
> ./run-benchmark.sh -g 1 -n 100
> ```
> * The KSP solver options and preconditioner type can be changed using the `-ksp` and `-pc` options respectively, and providing a string of options inside `""`. Default options are set by the `run-benchmark.sh` script. For example to use the `-pc_type gamg` preconditioner type, one can specify:
> ```
> ./run-benchmark.sh -g 1 -n 100 -pc "-pc_type gamg"
> ```
> * `-l` dumps a log at the end of the PETSc run and can be useful to investigate the statistics. To enable this, use the command: 
> ```
> ./run-benchmark.sh -g 1 -n 100 -pc "-pc_type gamg" -l
> ```

The benchmark script prints the result to the screen/terminal. A sample output can look like:
```

## Performance Considerations
PETSc has not previously provided a benchmark for performance evaluation, but the current benchmark was recently introduced to facilitate comparisons of performance as parameters and hardware are varied.  The figure of merit (FoM) used by the Poisson Solve benchmark is "Degrees of Freedom per second" (DoF/sec), with a larger DoF/sec indicating better performance.

PETSc examples in general have nearly infinite combinations of parameters (e.g., `-ksp_type`, `-pc_type`, `-ksp_rtol`, etc) suited for particular situations. For this particular performance benchmark the main parameter to tune is the cube dimension, specified with the `-n`parameter, e.g.: `-n <cube_dim>`.  The total number of degrees of freedom (aka cube size) is the value `-n <cube_dim>` cubed. The default value is **200** or 1e6 degrees of freedom. These guidelines should be followed:
 
1. The cube dimension should "saturate" hardware utilization.
1. Use the same cube dimension when comparing across different hardware.
1. Error norm should be the same for a given dimension and concurrency.
 
## Cube Dimension Guidance
Regarding the dimension to use to "saturate" hardware utilization, PETSc developers recommend using a "work-time spectrum" analysis to identify the range of optimal problem sizes for a particular solver.  In other words, with a fixed concurrency (e.g., _X_ GPUs) you incrementally increase the cube dimension (using `-n <cube_dim>`) until you see the DOF/Sec remain consistent. A dimension too small you'll likely see a small FoM because of low GPU utilization; a dimension too large you'll also see a small FoM either because of hardware limitations (e.g., cache misses) or suboptimal algorithmic convergence of the solver.
 
For example, for a single MI210 GPU a cube dimension around 200 will typically "saturate" hardware utilization, so testing with a range of 100 to 500 should confirm a value that is optimal for a test system with 1 MI210.  Ensure that the global cube size is large enough so that multiple GPUs and/or nodes still process an optimal subset of the cube.
 
Different hardware may have different "optimal" regions.  For a fair comparison of hardware devices, pick a cube dimension that universally "saturates" all the devices being compared.
