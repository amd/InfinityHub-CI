# MiniHACC

## Overview
Mini-HACC is a proxy application for the Hardware Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) led by Argonne National Laboratory.  
Mini-HACC performs the short-range gravity force calculations found in HACC. Leveraging the nbody technique, mini-HACC computes N2 particle pair-wise interactions and is fairly compute limited.

## Running Mini-HACC 

### Docker Pull
```
docker pull amdih/minihacc:1.0.amd3_129
```
#### Docker Interactive
```
docker run --rm -it \
    --device=/dev/kfd \
    --device=/dev/dri \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    amdih/minihacc:1.0.amd3_129 /bin/bash
```

#### Docker Single Command
```
docker run --rm -it \
    --device=/dev/kfd \
    --device=/dev/dri \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    amdih/minihacc:1.0.amd3_129 <Mini-HACC Command>
```

### Singularity  

#### Build Singularity image from Docker
To build a Singularity image from the locally created docker file do the following:
```
singularity pull minihacc.sif docker://amdih/minihacc:1.0.amd3_129
```

#### Singularity Interactive
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity shell --no-home --writable-tmpfs minihacc.sif
```

#### Singularity Single Command
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity run --no-home --writable-tmpfs minihacc.sif <Mini-HACC Command>
```

### Running Mini-HACC Benchmark
The Benchmark applications provided in this container are simple proxy apps for HACC encapsulating only the gravity force calculation.  
There are two benchmarks provided with mini-HACC that stress either **FP32**, single precision, or **FP64**, double precision, compute rates.

**FP32**
```
/opt/minihacc/bin/mini-HACC
```

**FP64**
```
/opt/minihacc/bin/mini-HACC-fp64
```
