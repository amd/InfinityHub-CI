## Running StarCCM+
The following is an example of how to run StarCCM+. 
> **NOTES:**
> - Make sure to include `-cpubind gpgpuawre`. 
> - Replace `<NGPU>` with the number of GPUs to use for the problem. Using insufficient GPUs for the problem size will cause unexpected exits.   
> - This example using `OpenMPI` to use other replace `openmpi` with the mpi implementation of your cluster. 
> - This example is running a benchmark, with 40 pre-iterations (`-preits`) and 20 iterations (`-nits`).
> - Be sure to replace the `<example.sim>` with the input file to be tested. 

```
starccm+ -mpi openmpi -np <NGPU> -cpubind gpgpuaware -gpgpu auto:<NGPU>  -benchmark "-preits 40 -nits 20  -nps <NGPU>"  <example.sim>
```
