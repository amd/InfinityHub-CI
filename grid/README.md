# Grid

## Overview
Grid is a library for lattice QCD calculations that employs a high-level data parallel approach while using a number of techniques to target multiple types of parallelism. The library currently supports MPI, OpenMP and short vector parallelism. The SIMD instructions sets covered include SSE, AVX, AVX2, FMA4, IMCI and AVX512. Recent releases expanded this support to include GPU offloading. The code requires at least one AMD GPU to run. 

The source code is available on [github](https://github.com/paboyle/Grid).

## Build Recipes

## Running Grid Benchmarks
These examples are using the Container built using  [Grid Docker Build](/grid/docker/). 

Grid has many examples within the project `/opt/grid/bin/` directory. 

You can run the examples using the command syntax below, where   
`<gpus>` is the number of GPUs to use   
`./benchmark/gpu_bind.sh` defines the CPU to GPU NUMA mapping  
 `<benchmark-to-run>` is the name of the benchmark to run  
 `<threads>` is the number of threads to use  
  `<i>` is the MPI configuration   

```
mpirun -np <gpus> ./benchmark/gpu_bind.sh <benchmark-to-run>  \
    --accelerator-threads <threads> --mpi <i> --shm 2048
```
The  `./benchmark/gpu_bind.sh` command may need to be updated for your specific CPU / GPU combination.  Use the `lscpu` command, to determine your NUMA configuration, and map the values back into the gpu_bind.sh command.

A combination of values for the MPI configuration, number of threads, gpus and other input parameters should be tested to achieve the highest throughput for your specific system.

### Examples 

* 1 GPU using Benchmark_ITT  
```
mpirun -np 1 /benchmark/gpu_bind.sh Benchmark_ITT --accelerator-threads 1 --mpi 1.1.1.1 --shm 2048
```

* 4 GPUs using Benchmark_ITT  
```
mpirun -np 4 /benchmark/gpu_bind.sh Benchmark_ITT --accelerator-threads 4 --mpi 4.1.1.1 --shm 2048
```

* 8 GPUs using Benchmark_ITT  
```
mpirun -np 8 /benchmark/gpu_bind.sh Benchmark_ITT --accelerator-threads 8 --mpi 8.1.1.1 --shm 2048
```

Each MPI rank will bind to a particular unique GPU (1 rank per device) and strong-scale the problem accordingly.
