# Kokkos

## Description
Kokkos is a C++ library and programming model designed to help with the development of HPC applications.
It provides a framework for writing code that can runs on various hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUS, and accelerators.
Kokkos allows code to be written that targets complex architectures with multiple memory hierarchies and execution resources. 
Kokkos-Kernels is a utility library affiliated with Kokkos that implements common computational kernels for linear algebra and graph operations. 
The Kokkos-Kernels library also supports ROCm tools libraries such as rocBLAS and rocSPARSE.

## Building Recipes
[Docker/Singularity Build](/kokkos/docker/)


## Getting started with Kokkos
The build recipe provided here is to provide a clean environment to work with Kokkos and to help facilitate creating a Kokkos-Enabled application. 
In the docker container, the environment has been setup so that the headers and libraries have been included in the environment and are ready to build on top of.  
Popular projects that use Kokkos: [LAMMPS](/lammps/), [Trillnos](https://trilinos.github.io/), [BabelStream](https://github.com/UoB-HPC/BabelStream)

There are many more options that can be added, they are listed on [Kokkos Wiki](https://kokkos.github.io/kokkos-core-wiki/keywords.html). Each project is unique with different requirements, the build provided here is very basic with the tests enabled. With these tests Kokkos can be tuned for any environment.

To run the tests in the provided container instructions, [start up the image](/kokkos/docker/README.md#running-kokkos-container).  
To run Kokkos' suite of tests, use: 
```
cd /kokkos/build
ctest
```
To run the Kokkos-Kernels tests:
```
cd /kokkoskernels/build
ctest
```
