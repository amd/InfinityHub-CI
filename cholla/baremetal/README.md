# Cholla Bare Metal Build Instructions 

## Overview
This document provides instructions on how to do a bare metal install of Cholla in a Linux environment. 

## Single-Node Server Requirements
| CPUs | GPUs | Operating Systems | ROCm™ Driver |
| ---- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| X86_64 CPU(s) | AMD Instinct MI200 GPU(s) <br>  AMD Instinct MI100 GPU(s) | Ubuntu 20.04 <br> Ubuntu 22.04 <BR> RHEL8 <br> RHEL9 <br> SLES 15 sp4 | ROCm v5.x compatibility |

For ROCm installation procedures and validation checks, see:

* [AMD Lab Notes ROCm installation notes](https://github.com/amd/amd-lab-notes/tree/release/rocm-installation).
* [ROCm Examples](https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples)

## System Dependencies
|Application|Minimum|Recommended|
|---|---|---|
|Git|Latest|Latest|
|ROCm|5.3.0|5.4.2|
|OpenMPI|4.0.3|4.1.5|
|UCX|1.13.0|1.14.1|
|HDF5|1.12.1|1.14.1|

## Installing Cholla

1. Validate the Cluster/System has all of the above applications, with system path, library, and include environments set correctly. If you are unsure, the [Dockerfile](/cholla/docker/Dockerfile) has examples of all useful configurations listed after the `ENV` commands. 
2. Clone the [Cholla GIT repo](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla.git) into your workspace. 
```bash
git clone -b CAAR --recursive https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla.git
```
3. Customize the host file for the Cluster. An example [make.host](/cholla/docker/make.host.cholla-container) file is available. The build will use the host name of the system or environment variable `CHOLLA_MACHINE` for build details. 
    - Save a copy of the [make.host](/cholla/docker/make.host.cholla-container) in `/path/to/cholla/builds` to build and/or run benchmarks. 
    - Rename it appropriately for the cluster/system to be built/run on. 
    - Update `OMPI_ROOT`, `HDF5_ROOT` and `ROCM_PATH` in the make.host file to match your cluster. 
4. Building Cholla
```bash
cd /path/to/cholla
make
```
5. (Optional) Adding Cholla to System Path  
After the build has completed a binary will be created at `cholla/bin/cholla.hydro.[hostname]`. 
This binary can be moved without causing linking issues and placed appropriately for your cluster.
**Be sure to add the Binary to your PATH!**
```bash
PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cholla/bin
```
> Installation Recommendations:
> - Use branch: `CAAR` 
> - Installing 'in place' can allow for ease of use and future updates. 
>   - Example benchmark/workloads located in `cholla/examples` 
>   - Adding clusters make.host.[host-name] file to `cholla/builds` for easy future builds.
