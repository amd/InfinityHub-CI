# OpenFOAM with PETSc Solver

OpenFOAM is the free, open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software developed primarily by OpenCFD Ltd since 2004. It has a large user base across most areas of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic organizations. OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to acoustics, solid mechanics and electro-magnetics.

OpenFOAM is professionally released every six months to include customer sponsored developments and contributions from the community. It is independently tested by ESI-OpenCFD's Application Specialists, Development Partners and selected customers, and supported by ESI's worldwide infrastructure, values and commitment.

Quality assurance is based on rigorous testing. The process of code evaluation, verification and validation includes several hundred daily unit tests, a medium-sized test battery run on a weekly basis, and large industry-based test battery run prior to new version releases. Tests are designed to assess regression behavior, memory usage, code performance and scalability

## Running OpenFOAM
This section describes how to launch two HPC Benchmarks approved by the [OpenFOAM HPC Technical Committee](https://wiki.openfoam.com/High_Performance_Computing\_(HPC)\_Technical\_Committee). For the container there are [OpenFoam Benchmark Scripts](/openfoam/docker/scripts/) that have been included at `/benchmark` inside the container that allow running the `Lid_driven_cavity-3D` and `HPC_motorbike` benchmarks, respectively. If OpenFOAM has been installed with ROCm and MPI support, similarly to the [OpenFOAM container](/openfoam/docker/Dockerfile) these [OpenFoam Benchmark Scripts](/openfoam/docker/scripts/) will work in any environment. 
> NOTE:  
> All benchmarks available from the [OpenFOAM HPC Technical Committee](https://develop.openfoam.com/committees/hpc) are available in the [OpenFOAM Docker Image](/openfoam/docker/Dockerfile) in the `/benchmark/HPC_Benchmark` directory and can be run by following the instructions provided in the repository. Follow a similar procedure for your customized workloads/benchmarks to use PETSc solvers and enable GPU offloading.


### Run OpenFOAM Benchmarks
There are a few options that can be applied to both benchmarks. 

```
-h | --help      Prints the usage
-g | --ngpus     #GPUs to be used (between 1-10), defaults to 1
-r | --run-only  skip mesh build, and directly run the case
-c | --clean     Clean the case directory
-v | --verbose   Prints all logs from different stages for easy debugging
```

HPC Motorbike benchmark:
```
./bench-hpc-motorbike.sh -g 8 -v
```
LID Driven Cavity 3D benchmark:
```
./bench-lid-driven-cavity.sh -g 8 -v
```


> NOTE:
> * If the `-g` is not mentioned in commands above, by default the script will use 1 GPU. But for consistency, we recommend always adding the `-g` to prescribe #GPUs.
> * The number of GPUs can be altered to run on multiple GPUs. When #GPUs>1, the number of MPI ranks used will be equal to the number of GPUs. For example, when launched with 4 GPUs, 4 MPI ranks will be deployed. The script will automatically  adjust the MPI ranks to the number of GPUs.
> * It must be noted that the script is designed to run on a maximum of 10 GPUs at a time, and will require alteration if #GPUs>10 need to be used. One can also assign multiple-MPI ranks to each GPU, however that is not included in these bash scripts.
> * When a benchmark is run using the script above, the mesh for the case is generated in `Stage #1`. Generally this stage can take some time (~10-30mins depending on the benchmark). To re-run the benchmark with a different set of #GPU count, one can skip the pre-processing and setup `Stage #1` by passing the `-r` argument to the bash script. For example, let's consider that `Lid_driven_cavity-3D` benchmark was initially run with 1 GPU. To re-run the same benchmark with 4 GPUs, one can use the following command to skip `Stage #1` and save time on setup  
>``` 
> ./bench-lid-driven-cavity.sh -g 4 -r -v
>```
> * The `-v` enables verbose output that prints more details for the benchmark as it runs for several time steps. 

At the end of the run, the benchmark script prints the final results on the terminal and extracts the figure-of-merit (FOM) for reference. An example of the final result from the `Lid_driven_cavity-3D` with 8 GPUs benchmark is:
