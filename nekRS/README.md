# nekRS


## Overview
[nekRS](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) nekRS is a computational fluid dynamics code developed at ANL, UIUC, and PSU. nekRS aims to leverage the present trend in GPU-based HPC systems to perform CFD on GPU-accelerated systems. By using the OCCA library’s unified API, nekRS can run on CPUs and on GPU-accelerated CPUs that support CUDA, HIP, or OpenCL.


## Single-Node Server Requirements

| CPUs | GPUs | Operating Systems | ROCm™ Driver | Container Runtimes | 
| ---- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | 
| X86_64 CPU(s) | AMD Instinct MI300 APU(s)/GPU(s) <br> AMD Instinct MI200 GPU(s) <br>  AMD Instinct MI100 GPU(s) <br>  | Ubuntu 20.04 <br> Ubuntu 22.04 <BR> RHEL8 <br> RHEL9 <br> SLES 15 sp4 | ROCm v5.x+ compatibility |[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) <br> [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/) |

## Running nekRS Benchmark
There are several [examples](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS/tree/master/examples) available within the nekRS repo.

This document will show how to run the turbPipePeriodic benchmark which is provided in this repo.

First navigate the turbPipePeriodic directory
```
cd path/to/nekrs/examples/turbPipePeriodic
```
Set Environment Variable NEKRS_HOME
```
export NEKRS_HOME=/path/to/nekrs
```
Run the turbPipe benchmark \
 **_NOTE:_** -np option provides number of GPUs. This is a 2 GPU example
```
mpirun -np 2 nekrs --setup turbPipe.par
```
