# Cholla

## Overview
Cholla is a static-mesh, GPU-native hydrodynamics simulation code that efficiently runs high-resolution simulations on massively-parallel computers. The code is written in a combination of C++, Cuda C, and HIP, and requires at least one AMD GPU to run. 

Cholla (Computational Hydrodynamics On ParaLLel Architectures) is a 3D GPU-based hydrodynamics code (Schneider & Robertson, ApJS, 2015). Cholla is designed to be run using (AMD or NVIDIA) GPUs, and can be run in serial mode using one GPU or with MPI for multiple GPUs. 

The source code is available on [github](https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla/). Cholla was designed for astrophysics simulations, and the current release includes the following physics:
- compressible hydrodynamics in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions
- optically-thin radiative cooling and photoionization heating, including the option to use the Grackle cooling library
- static gravity with user-defined functions
- FFT-based gas self-gravity
- particle-mesh based particle gravity
- cosmology
- passive scalar tracking

Cholla can be run using a variety of different numerical algorithms, allowing users to test the sensitivity of their results to the exact code configuration. Options include:
- Exact, Roe, and HLLC Riemann solvers
- 2nd and 3rd order spatial reconstruction with limiting in either primitive or conserved variables
- a second order Van Leer integrator

## Build Recipes
- [Bare Metal Build](/cholla/baremetal/)
- [Docker/Singularity Build](/cholla/docker/)

## Running Cholla Benchmarks
These examples are using the [Cholla Docker Build](/cholla/docker/), which build the binary file cholla.hydro.cholla-container based on environment variable `CHOLLA_MACHINE` set to `cholla-container` and was build/installed into `/opt/cholla`. 

Cholla has many examples within the project, `/path/to/cholla/examples/`, find the benchmark that you wish to run in there, or provide your own workload.   

You can run the examples using the command syntax below, where `#` is the number of GPUs to use and `<benchmark-to-run>` should be replaced with the full file path to the load details. 

```
mpirun -np # cholla.hydro.cholla-container <benchmark-to-run>
```
### Examples: 
* 4 GPU 3D sound wave
```
mpirun -np 4 cholla.hydro.cholla-container /opt/cholla/examples/3D/sound_wave.txt
```
* 8 GPU 3D Sound wave
```
mpirun -np 8 cholla.hydro.cholla-container /opt/cholla/examples/3D/sound_wave.txt
```
* 4 GPU 3D sod<br> 
```
mpirun -np 4 cholla.hydro.cholla-container /opt/cholla/examples/3D/sod.txt
```
* 8 GPU 3D sod<br> 
```
mpirun -np 8 cholla.hydro.cholla-container /opt/cholla/examples/3D/sod.txt
```

Each MPI rank will bind to a particular unique GPU (1 rank per device) and strong-scale the problem accordingly. Please define `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to control which particular GPUs are available to Cholla.
