## OpenFOAM Docker Build
Instructions on how to build a Docker Container with OpenFOAM.

## Build System Requirements
- Git
- Docker

## Inputs
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command  

- ### IMAGE
    Default: `rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04:5.7-complete`  
    Docker Tags found: 
    - [ROCm Ubuntu 22.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04)
    > Note:  
    > The `*-complete` version has all the components required for building and installation.  
    

- ### OPENFOAM_VERSION
    Default: `v2212`  
    Branch/Tag found: [OpenFOAM repo](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam)

- ### SCOTCH_VER
    Default: `7.0.3`  
    Branch/Tag found: [Scotch repo](https://gitlab.inria.fr/scotch/scotch.git)

- ### PETSC_VER
    Default: `3.19.0`  
    Branch/Tag found: [PETSc repo](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc)  
    >NOTE:  
    >Initial HIP support was added in v3.18.0 with further optimizations included in minor releases. We recommend using v3.19 or newer for performance runs on AMD hardware

- ### UCX_BRANCH
    Default: `v1.14.1`  
    Branch/Tag found: [UXC repo](https://github.com/openucx/ucx)

- ### OMPI_BRANCH
    Default: `v4.1.5`  
    Branch/Tag found: [OpenMPI repo](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi)

## Building OpenFOAM Container
- Download the everything in [OpenFOAM/docker](/openfoam/docker/)  


To run the default configuration:
```
docker build -t mycontainer/openfoam -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
> NOTES:  
> - `mycontainer/openfoam` is an example container name.
> - the `.` at the end of the build line is important! It tells Docker where your build context is located!
> - `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context, if you are building in the same directory it is not required. 
> - The `scripts` directory is required within the build context directory, and the contents will be copied into the container.

To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized build-arg  
*DISCLAIMER:* This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Using a different base image or branch may result in build failures or poor performance.
```
docker build \
    -t mycontainer/openfoam \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg IMAGE=rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04:5.3.3-complete \
    --build-arg OPENFOAM_VERSION=master \
    --build-arg SCOTCH_VER=master \
    --build-arg PETSC_VER=main \
    --build-arg UCX_BRANCH=master \
    --build-arg OMPI_BRANCH=main \
    . 
```
## Running OpenFOAM in a Container
Both Docker and Singularity can be run interactively or as a single command.
To run the [OpenFOAM Benchmarks](/openfoam/README.md#running-openfoam-benchmarks), just replace the `<OpenFOAM Command>` the examples in [Running OpenFOAM Benchmarks](/openfoam/README.md#running-openfoam-benchmarks) section of the OpenFOAM readme. The commands can be run directly in an interactive session as well.

### Docker 

#### Docker Interactive
Launching Docker Container
```
docker run --device=/dev/kfd \
           --device=/dev/dri \
           --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
           -it  mycontainer/openfoam  bash
```
#### Docker Single Command 
```
docker run --device=/dev/kfd \
           --device=/dev/dri \
           --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
           -it  mycontainer/openfoam \
           <OpenFOAM Command> 
```

### Singularity

To build a Singularity image from the locally created docker file do the following:
```
singularity build openfoam.sif docker-daemon://mycontainer/openfoam:latest
```

### Singularity Interactive 
Launch a Singularity Image
```
singularity shell --writable-tmpfs \
                    --no-home \
                    --pwd /benchmark \
                    openfoam.sif
```

#### Singularity Single Command
```
singularity run --writable-tmpfs \
                    --no-home \
                    --pwd /benchmark \
                    openfoam.sif \
                    <OpenFOAM Command>
```
