# CP2K Container Build Instructions
This document provides instructions on how to build CP2K into a Docker container that is portable between environments.  

## Recommended ROCm Version
[ROCm 6.0](https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu-install/6.0/ubuntu/)  

## Build System Requirements
- Git
- Docker

## Inputs
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command  

- ### IMAGE
    Default: `rocm_gpu:6.1.1`  
    > ***Note:***  
    >  This container needs to be build using [Base ROCm GPU](/base-gpu-mpi-rocm-docker/Dockerfile).

- ### OMPI_BRANCH
    Default: `v4.1.5`  
    Branch/Tag found: [OpenMPI repo](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi)

- ### GPU_VER
    Default: `Mi250`   
    Options: `Mi50`, `Mi100`, `Mi250`  
    Specifies the GPU architecture for which DBCSR will be built. Mi250 is used for all MI200 series accelerators.


## Build Instructions
Download the [CP2K Dockerfile](/cp2k-docker/Dockerfile).

To build the default configuration:
```bash
docker build -t mycontainer/cp2k -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
>Notes:  
>- `mycontainer/cp2k` will be the name of your local container.
>- the `.` at the end of the build line is important! It tells Docker where your build context is located.
>- `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context.

To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized `--build-arg` parameter.  
*DISCLAIMER*: This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Using a different base image or branch may result in build failures or poor performance.
```bash
docker build \
    -t mycontainer/cp2k \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg CP2K_BRANCH=master \
    --build-arg GPU_VER=Mi100 \
    . 
```

## Run CP2K Container

Both Docker and Singularity can be run interactively or as a single command.

To run the [CP2K Benchmarks](/cp2k/README.md#running-cp2k-benchmarks), just replace the `<cp2k Command>` the examples in [Running CP2K Benchmarks](/cp2k/README.md#running-cp2k-benchmarks) section of the CP2K readme. The commands can be run directly in an interactive session as well.
> **CP2K Executables**  
> In this container, you will find two CP2K executables, each tuned for different sets of benchmarks.  
>- For RPA Benchmarks:`cp2k.psmp.no_dbcsr_gpu`  
>    This executable has been built without the DBCSR GPU backend as it improves the performance of Random Phase Approximation (RPA) benchmarks.
>- For DFT Benchmarks:`cp2k.psmp.no_pw_gpu`  
>    This executable has been built without the PW GPU backend as it improves the performance of Linear Scaling Density Functional Theory (LS-DFT) benchmarks.
> To run this benchmarks you will need to update the command from [Running CP2K Benchmarks](/cp2k/README.md#running-cp2k-benchmarks) to use the binary specified. 


### Docker  
If you want access any output files generated during the run, please add `-v $(pwd):/tmp` before `mycontainer/cp2k` in the following commands. 
For interactive, be sure to copy any files to `/tmp` before exiting the container. For Single Command runs, you can set the output to `/tmp` or set your working directory using `--workdir /tmp`.
#### Docker Interactive
```bash
docker run --rm -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -e PMIX_MCA_gds=^ds21 mycontainer/cp2k /bin/bash
```

#### Docker Single Command
```bash
docker run --rm --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -e PMIX_MCA_gds=^ds21 mycontainer/cp2k bash -c "<cp2k Command>"
```

### Singularity  
To build a Singularity image from the locally created docker file do the following:
```bash
singularity build cp2k.sif docker-daemon://mycontainer/cp2k:latest
```
#### Singularity Interactive
To launch a Singularity image build locally
```bash
singularity shell --no-home --writable-tmpfs cp2k.sif
```

#### Singularity Single Command
```bash
singularity run --no-home --writable-tmpfs cp2k.sif bash -c "<cp2k Command>"
```
> The `bash -c "<cp2k Command>"` Allows for multiple commands to be sent to the running container at once, which is required for some of the more complex CP2K benchmarks.
