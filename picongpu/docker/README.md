# PIconGPU Docker Build Instructions
Instructions on how to build a Docker Container with PIconGPU.


## System Requirements
- Git
- Docker

## Inputs:
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command    

- ### IMAGE
    Default: `rocm_gpu:6.1.1`  
    > ***Note:***  
    >  This container needs to be build using [Base ROCm GPU](/base-gpu-mpi-rocm-docker/Dockerfile).


- ### PICONGPU_BRANCH
    Default: default: `dev`  
    Branch/Tag found: [ PIconGPU repo](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu).
    >NOTE:  
    >master branch branch has different tests, benchmarks, examples. The test build into this container is not available the master branch at this time.

- ### HDF5_BRANCH
    Default: `hdf5-1_14_1`  
    Branch/Tag found: [HDF5 repo](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5.git)

- ### ALPAKA_BRANCH
    Default:  `develop`
    Branch/Tag found: [Alpaka repo](https://github.com/alpaka-group/alpaka.git)


## Building PIconGPU Container:
To run the default configuration:
```
docker build -t mycontainer/picongpu -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
>Notes:  
>- `mycontainer/picongpu` will be the name of your local container.
>- the `.` at the end of the build line is important! It tells Docker where your build context is located!
>- `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context. If you are building in the same directory it is not required. 



To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized build-arg  
*DISCLAIMER:* This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Using a different base image or branch may result in build failures or poor performance. 
```
docker build \
    -t mycontainer/PIconGPU \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg PICONGPU_BRANCH=dev \
    . 
```


## Running PIconGPU Container
This section describes how to launch the containers. It is assumed that up-to-versions of Docker and/or Singularity is installed on your system.
If needed, please consult with your system administrator or view official documentation. 
PNGwriter and HDF-5 have been provided inside this container to help generate visual outputs. To access outside of the container mount an output directory the container using dockers/singularity mount/volume API.

To run the [PIconGPU Benchmarks](/picongpu/README.md#running-picongpu-benchmark), just replace the `<PIconGPU Command>` the examples in [Running PIconGPU Benchmarks](/picongpu/README.md#running-picongpu-benchmark) section of the PIconGPU readme. The commands can be run directly in an interactive session as well. 

### Docker  

#### Docker Interactive
To run the container and build the benchmark interactively 
``` 
docker run --rm -it \
    --device /dev/dri \
    --device /dev/kfd \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    -w /opt/picon-examples/khi_fom \
    mycontainer/picongpu  /bin/bash
```

#### Docker Single Command
To run the benchmark using docker with a single command
```
docker run --rm -it \
    --device /dev/dri \
    --device /dev/kfd \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    -w  /opt/picon-examples/khi_fom \
    mycontainer/picongpu  \
    <PIconGPU Command> 
```

### Singularity  
This section assumes that an up-to-date version of Singularity is installed on your system and properly configured for your system. Please consult with your system administrator or view official Singularity documentation.
To build a Singularity container from your local Docker container, run the following command:
```
singularity build picongpu.sif docker-daemon://mycontainer/picongpu
```


#### Singularity Interactive
To launch a Singularity image build into an interactive session
```
singularity shell \
    --no-home \
    --pwd /opt/picon-examples/khi_fom \
    --writable-tmpfs \
    picongpu.sif 
```

#### Singularity Single Command
To launch a Singularity image with a single command, useful for batch scrips. 
```
singularity run \
    --no-home \
    --pwd /opt/picon-examples/khi_fom \
    --writable-tmpfs \
    picongpu.sif \
    <PIconGPU Command>
```
