# SPECFEM3D Spack Build Instructions

## Build System Requirements
- Git
- Spack (for local Spack build)
- Docker (for Docker build)

## Dependencies 
The Dependencies for the build are:

- ### specfem3d  source
    Location: [specfem3d repo](https://github.com/geodynamics/specfem3d)  
    Branch: `devel` of version 4.0.0  
    (or edit the version() call in [specfem3dcartesian_package.py](/specfem3dCartesian/docker/specfem3dcartesian_package.py))

- ### UCX 
    Location: [UXC repo](https://github.com/openucx/ucx)  
    Branch: `v1.14.1`   

- ### Open MPI
    Location: [OpenMPI repo](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi)  
    Branch: `v4.1.4`  


## Docker Version
Download the [specfem3d Docker script and other build code](/specfem3d/docker-spack) if you want build a Docker Container version of the code.

The Docker image can be built using the provided Dockerfile source file. Navigate to inside `docker` directory, issue the command:
```
sudo docker build --network=host -t specfem3d -f Dockerfile .
```
Please note that the period (dot) at the end of the command is actually part of the docker build syntax and must be included in your command.

This will build a Docker image named (tagged) specfem3d, from the input file docker/Dockerfile, starting in the current directory (".").
 
The build targets the MI250/gfx90a system, by default, and may be changed using `--build-arg GPU_ARCH=`  and `--build-arg GPU_MODEL=`  as appropriate.

## Without Docker Version
Download the [specfem3d Docker and Spack script and other build code](/specfem3d/docker-spack)

- The package contains a Docker Container specification that uses Spack to build the code. A standalone Spack specification can be created by extracting the Spack command. (*Unless you are planning on creating the package on your own, please use the Docker Version section of this document*)

- `specfem3dcartesian_package.py` contains the Spack specification for building SPECFEM3D. This file points to the source, defines prerequisite packages and sets some build arguments.  Note that SPECFEM3D is currently defined externally from Spack, via the specfem3dcartesian_package.py file and it will, eventually, be pushed to the standard Spack repository.
 
- `ucx_package.py` contains a slightly modified Spack UCX package that is required to use this code with AMD ROCm GPUs. 

- If you do not already have Spack installed, run the command to install Spack ( `git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true https://github.com/spack/spack.git`) starting in your home directory. 

To run the Spack build for SPECFEM3D, copy the provided specfem3d and ucx package to your Spack repo. For example,  
```
cp ucx_package.py                   $HOME/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/ucx/package.py  
cp specfem3dcartesian_package.py    $HOME/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/specfem3d/package.py  
```
Extract and run the Spack commands from the Dockerfile. You will need to edit the commands to remove the Docker related syntax.

On the first run, the build will take multiple hours to build all the components. 

## Locating the SPECFEM3D Spack Image
Spack compiles and links code into fairly self contained packages using the Linux rpath facilities. The location of the built package may be found using the `spack location` command:
```
source  $HOME/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack location --install-dir specfem3d
```
Use a symbolic link to create an easy to remember location, such as a "benchmark" directory (note the back ticks around the spack command):
```
ln -s `spack location --install-dir specfem3d` benchmarks
cd benchmarks
```
Inside the `benchmark` directory is the README.md file that is  provides instructions to run the application. 

The PATH environment variable may be extended to put the application directory on the active path:
```
spack location --install-dir specfem3d  
cd   [to output above]  
export PATH=\$PWD/bin:\$PATH  
```
