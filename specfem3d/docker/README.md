# SPECFEM3D Docker Build Instructions 
This document provides instructions on how to build SPECFEM3D into a Docker container that is portable between environments.

## Build System Requirements
- Git
- Docker

## Inputs
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command  

- ### IMAGE
    Default: `rocm_gpu:6.2.4`  
    > ***Note:***  
    >  This container needs to be build using [Base ROCm GPU](/base-gpu-mpi-rocm-docker/Dockerfile).

- ### SPECFEM3D_BRANCH
    Default: `4.1.1`  
    Branch/Tag found: [SPECFEM3D repo](https://github.com/specfem/specfem3d/)

## Building Container
Download the [Dockerfile](/specfem3d/docker/Dockerfile)

To run the default configuration:
```
docker build -t mycontainer/specfem3d -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
> Notes:  
>- `mycontainer` is an example container name.
>- the `.` at the end of the build line is important. It tells Docker where your build context is located.
>- `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context. If you are building in the same directory it is not required. 

To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized build-arg  
*DISCLAIMER:* This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Using a different base image or branch may result in build failures or poor performance.  
```
docker build \
    -t mycontainer/specfem3d \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg IMAGE=rocm_gpu=6.1.1 \
    --build-arg SPECFEM3D_BRANCH=devel
    . 
```

## Running an SPECFEM3D Container
Both Docker and Singularity can be run interactively or as a single command.

To run the [SPECFEM3D Benchmarks](/specfem3d/README.md#running-specfem3d-benchmarks), just replace the `<SPECFEM3D Command>` the examples in [Running SPECFEM3D Benchmarks](/specfem3d/README.md#running-specfem3d-benchmarks) section of the SPECFEM3D readme. The commands can be run directly in an interactive session as well. 

### Docker  

#### Docker Interactive
```
docker run --rm -it \
    --device=/dev/kfd \
    --device=/dev/dri \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    -w /benchmark/ \
    mycontainer/specfem3d /bin/bash
```
#### Docker Single Command
```
docker run --rm -it \
    --device=/dev/kfd \
    --device=/dev/dri \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    -w /benchmark/benchmarks/tiny/generation/ \
    -v $(pwd):/benchmark/benchmarks/tiny/generation/lattices  
    mycontainer/specfem3d <SPECFEM3D Command>
```

### Singularity  

#### Build Singularity image from Docker
To build a Singularity image from the locally created docker file do the following:
```
singularity build specfem3d.sif docker-daemon://mycontainer/specfem3d:latest
```

#### Singularity Interactive
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity shell \
    --no-home \
    --writable-tmpfs \
    --pwd /benchmark/ \
    specfem3d.sif
```

#### Singularity Single Command
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity run \
    --no-home \
    --writable-tmpfs \
    --pwd /benchmark/benchmarks/tiny/generation \
    specfem3d.sif <SPECFEM3D Command>
```
