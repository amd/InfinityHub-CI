# rocHPCG Bare Metal Build Instructions

## Overview
This document provides instructions on how to do a bare metal install of rocHPCG in a Linux environment. 

## Single-Node Server Requirements
| CPUs | GPUs | Operating Systems | ROCm™ Driver |
| ---- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| X86_64 CPU(s) | AMD Instinct MI200 GPU(s) <br>  AMD Instinct MI100 GPU(s) | Ubuntu 20.04 <br> Ubuntu 22.04 <BR> RHEL8 <br> RHEL9 <br> SLES 15 sp4 | ROCm v5.x compatibility <br> ROCm v6.x compatibility |

For ROCm installation procedures and validation checks, see:
* [ROCm Documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com)
* [AMD Lab Notes ROCm installation notes](https://github.com/amd/amd-lab-notes/tree/release/rocm-installation).
* [ROCm Examples](https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples)

## System Dependencies
|Application|Minimum|Recommended|
|---|---|---|
|Git|Latest|Latest|
|ROCm|5.3.0|5.4.2|
|CMAKE|3.22.2|Latest|
|OpenMPI (Optional)|4.0.3|4.1.5|
|UCX (Optional)|1.13.0|1.14.1|


## Installing rocHPCG
1. Validate the Cluster/System has all of the above applications, with system path, library, and include environments set correctly. If you are unsure, the [Dockerfile](/gromacs/docker/Dockerfile) has examples of all useful configurations listed after the `ENV` commands. 

2. Clone the [rocHPCG](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocHPCG.git) into your workspace. The `master` branch is the recommended. 
```
git clone -b master https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocHPCG.git
```

3. Navigate into the `rocHPCG` directory and runn the following command:
``` 
./install.sh \
      --with-mpi=</path/to/mpi>  \
      --with-rocm=</path/to/rocm> \
      --gpu-aware-mpi=ON \
      --with-openmp=ON \
      --with-memmgmt=ON \
      --with-memdefrag=ON
```
> - Replace `</path/to/ompi>` with the path to mpi implementation to use  
> - Replace `</path/to/rocm>` with the path to rocm installation to use  
> - If unsure of system dependencies are met, providing the `-d` parameter to install any dependencies necessary. 
> - If the `-i` parameter is used, it installs hpcg into rocm, and step 4 can be skipped. 

4. Link binary into correct path. 
This installation will create a binary `rochpcg`, if installed correctly will be:
`/path/to/rocHPCG/build/release/bin`
There is already a `hpcg` binary in `/rocm/bin` remove it 
```
rm -f /path/to/rocm/bin/hcpg
```
after it has been removed, link `rochpcg` in its place. 
```
ln -s /path/to/rocHPCG/build/release/bin/rochpcg /path/to/rocm/bin/rocm/bin/hpcg
```

5. (Optional) Add rocm/bin to System PATH.
If rocm is not already in the system PATH, it along with HPCG can be added with the following command
```bash
export PATH=PATH:/path/to/rocm/bin/
```
