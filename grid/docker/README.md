# Grid Docker Build Instructions 
This document provides instructions on how to build GRID into a Docker container that is portable between environments.  


## Inputs
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command  

- ### IMAGE
    Default: `rocm_gpu:6.2`  
    > ***Note:***  
    >  This container needs to be build using [Base ROCm GPU](/base-gpu-mpi-rocm-docker/Dockerfile).

- ### GRID_BRANCH
    Default: `develop`  
    Branch/Tag found: [Grid repo](https://github.com/paboyle/Grid)


## Building Container
Download the [Dockerfile related files](/grid/docker/).

To build the default configuration:
```
docker build -t mycontainer/grid -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
> Notes:  
>- `mycontainer` is an example container name.
>- the `.` at the end of the build line is important. It tells Docker where your build context is located.
>- `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context. If you are building in the same directory it is not required. 

To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized build-arg  

*DISCLAIMER:* This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Using a different base image or branch may result in build failures or poor performance.  

```
docker build \
    -t mycontainer/grid \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg GRID_BRANCH="v0.8.0"
    . 
```

## Running a Grid Container
Both Docker and Singularity can be run interactively or as a single command.

To run the [Grid Benchmarks](/grid/README.md#running-grid-benchmarks),  replace the `<Grid Command>` the examples in [Running Grid Benchmarks](/grid/README.md#running-grid-benchmarks) section of the Grid readme. The commands can be run directly in an interactive session as well. 

### Docker  
If you want to save files generated during the run, add `-v $(pwd):/host` before `mycontainer/grid` in the following commands.  Files may then be copied or saved between the container /host directory and the users working directory.

#### Docker Interactive
```
docker run --rm -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
          mycontainer/grid /bin/bash
```
### Docker Non-Interactive
```
docker run --rm -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
          mycontainer/grid <Grid Command>
```

### Singularity  
If you want to save files generated during the run, add `--bind $(pwd):/host` before `mycontainer/grid` in the following commands.  Files may then be copied or saved between the container /host directory and the users working directory.
#### Build Singularity image from Docker
To build a Singularity image from the locally created docker file do the following:
```
singularity build grid.sif docker-daemon://mycontainer/grid:latest
```

#### Singularity Interactive
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity shell --no-home --writable-tmpfs --pwd /benchmark grid.sif
```

#### Singularity Single Command
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity run --no-home --writable-tmpfs --pwd /benchmark grid.sif <Grid Command>
```
