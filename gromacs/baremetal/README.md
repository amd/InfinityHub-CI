# AMD's Implementation of Gromacs with HIP Bare Metal Build Instructions

## Overview
This document provides instructions on how to do a bare metal install of AMD's Implementation of Gromacs with HIP in a Linux environment. 

## Single-Node Server Requirements
| CPUs | GPUs | Operating Systems | ROCm™ Driver |
| ---- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| X86_64 CPU(s) | AMD Instinct MI200 GPU(s) <br>  AMD Instinct MI100 GPU(s) | Ubuntu 20.04 <br> Ubuntu 22.04 <BR> RHEL8 <br> RHEL9 <br> SLES 15 sp4 | ROCm v5.x compatibility <br> ROCm v6.x compatibility |

For ROCm installation procedures and validation checks, see:
* [ROCm Documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com)
* [AMD Lab Notes ROCm installation notes](https://github.com/amd/amd-lab-notes/tree/release/rocm-installation).
* [ROCm Examples](https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples)



## System Dependencies
|Application|Minimum|Recommended|
|---|---|---|
|Git|Latest|Latest|
|ROCm|5.3.0|latest|
|CMAKE|3.22.2|Latest|
|OpenMPI (Optional)|4.0.3|5.0.3|
|UCX (Optional)|1.13.0|1.16.0|


## Installing AMD's Implementation of Gromacs with HIP
1. Validate the Cluster/System has all of the above applications, with system path, library, and include environments set correctly. If you are unsure, the [Dockerfile](/gromacs/docker/Dockerfile) has examples of all useful configurations listed after the `ENV` commands. 
2. Clone the [GROMACS repository](https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs.git) into your workspace. Use the 4947-hip-feature-enablement feature enablement branch to use the version with all supported features enabled.. 
```
git clone -b 4947-hip-feature-enablement https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs.git

```
3. Navigate to the `gromacs` folder and create a build folder within the workspace to build the code in. 
```bash
cd gromacs
mkdir build
cd build
```

4. Run cmake command. The variable `OPEN_MPI_ENABLED` has been included, please set it accordingly. By default GROMACS will build for a number of current AMD CDNA and RDNA architectures. You can change this by setting the `GMX_HIP_TARGET_ARCH` variable to the exact architecture you want to build for
>- Threaded MPI (Recommended): `off`
>- For OpenMPI: `on`

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON \
        -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ \
        -DGMX_MPI=${OPEN_MPI_ENABLED} \
        -DGMX_GPU=HIP \
        -DREGRESSIONTEST_DOWNLOAD=OFF \
      ..
```

5. Complete the install with the following make commands
```bash
make -j $(nproc)
make install
```

6. Adding Gromacs system environment variables
```bash
export GMX_ENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_COMM=1
export GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU=1
export ROC_ACTIVE_WAIT_TIMEOUT=0
export AMD_DIRECT_DISPATCH=1
```
Optional, By default Gomacs is installed to: `/usr/local/gromacs`
Adding Gromacs to the system PATH and Library path can be done as follows:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/user/local/gromacs/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/user/local/gromacs/lib
```
