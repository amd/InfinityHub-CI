# CHROMA

## Overview
The Chroma package supports data-parallel programming constructs for lattice field theory and in particular lattice QCD. It uses the SciDAC QDP++ data-parallel programming (in C++) that presents a single high-level code image to the user, but can generate highly optimized code for many architectural systems including single node workstations, multi and many-core nodes, clusters of nodes via QMP, and classic vector computers.

## Build Recipes
- [Docker/Singularity Build](/chroma/docker/)


## Running Chroma Benchmarks
The benchmark used for Chroma can be downloaded from [NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/hpc/containers/chroma), look for szscl_bench.zip.
This has already been provided in the [Chroma Docker Build](/chroma/docker/Dockerfile#L320).

Once Chroma has been installed with all of the components,  and the benchmark files have been extracted to a working directory there are a couple environment variables that are recommended to pass in or set on the system. 

```
QUDA_ENABLE_P2P=0
QUDA_ENABLE_GDR=0
QUDA_RESOURCE_PATH=/tmp/
```

`QUDA_RESOURCE_PATH` is where several tuning files will be generated on the first run. This can be stored anywhere with read/write permissions are available. They are used on all subsequent runs for that system. 
The first run on each system/configuration can take up to 2-3x longer due to generating these tuning files. It is recommended to run the provided Chroma benchmark once, to generate these tuning files, before processing a workload. 

### Example:
The `#` should be replaced by the number of GPUs to be used. 
`QUDA_RESOUCE_PATH` should be provided similar to examples below. If not set as an environment variable or at run time, it will create the tuning files in the directory the command is executed from.  

```
QUDA_RESOURCE_PATH=/path/to/tuning mpirun -n # chroma -i ./test.ini.xml -geom 1 1 1 # -ptxdb ./qdpdb -gpudirect
```
