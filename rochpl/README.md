# rocHPL

Instructions are provided to build rocHPL (HPL), using Spack (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, https://spack.io) as the package builder. Instructions for creating the Spack package using a Docker (Docker, Inc., https://docker.com) Container are also provided in this document. A pre-built rocHPL Docker Container will not be provided on AMD Infinity Hub. 

## Overview
HPL, or High-Performance Linpack, is a benchmark which solves a uniformly random system of linear equations and reports floating-point execution rate. This documentation supports the implementation of the HPL benchmark on top of AMD's ROCm platform.

## Dependencies 
The Dependencies for the build are:

- ### rocHPL source
    Location: [rocHPL Repo](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocHPL.git)  
    Branch: main

- ### UCX 
    Location: [UXC repo](https://github.com/openucx/ucx)  
    Branch: v1.13.1  

- ### Open MPI
    Location: [OpenMPI repo](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi)  
    Branch: v4.1.4

## Building rocHPL
### Spack 
Download the [rocHPL Spack script and other build code](/rochpl/spack)


- `rochpl.package.py` contains the Spack specification for building rocHPL. This file points to the source, defines prerequisite packages and sets some build arguments.  Note that rochpl is currently defined externally from Spack, via the rochpl.package.py file and it will, eventually, be pushed to the standard Spack repository. 
- `bldRochpl.sh` is the script that will build the application. If you do not already have Spack installed, run the command to install Spack ( `git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true https://github.com/spack/spack.git`) starting in your home directory. Also, locate the file, `omp.h` (typically part of your standard compiler installation). Update the  HIPCC_COMPILE_FLAGS_APPEND variable to point to the directory containing `omp.h`.

To run the default Spack build for rocHPL:
```
./bldRochpl.sh
```
The build script is only a template for building the Spack application. You may need to edit the script for your own environment.

On the first run, the build will take multiple hours to build all the components. 

#### Locating the rocHPL Spack Image
Spack compiles and links code into fairly self contained packages using the Linux rpath facilities. The location of the built package may be found using the `spack location` command:
```
source  $HOME/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack location --install-dir rochpl
```
Use a symbolic link to create an easy to remember location, such as a "benchmark" directory (note the back ticks around the spack command):
```
ln -s `spack location --install-dir rochpl` benchmark
cd benchmark
```
Inside the `benchmark/bin` directory is the `mpirun_rochpl` script that is used to run the rochpl application. The PATH environment variable may be extended to put that directory on the active path:
`export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH`

### Docker
Download the [rocHPL Docker script and other build code](/rochpl/docker) if you want build a Docker Container version of the code.

The Docker image can be built using the provided Dockerfile source file. Starting in the directory that contains the `docker` directory, issue the command:
```
docker build -t rochpl.6.0 -f Dockerfile .
```
Please note that the period (dot) at the end of the command is actually part of the docker build syntax and must be included in your command.

This will build a Docker image named (tagged) rochpl.6.0, from the input file Docker/dockerfile, starting in the current directory (".").


## Running rocHPL
The  **rocHPL**  benchmark provides a helpful wrapper script in  `mpirun_rochpl`. This script has two distinct run modes:

1) All command line input

`mpirun_rochpl -P <P> -Q <P> -N <N> --NB <NB> -f <frac>  `
 where  
 P - is the number of rows in the MPI grid  
 Q - is the number of columns in the MPI grid  
 N - is the total number of rows/columns of the global matrix  
 NB - is the panel size in the blocking algorithm  
 frac - is the split-update fraction (important for hiding some MPI communication)

This run script will launch a total of np=PxQ MPI processes.

2) Input using a file 

The second run mode takes an input file together with a number of MPI processes:

`mpirun_rochpl -P <p> -Q <q> -i <input> -f <frac> ` 
 where  
 P - is the number of rows in the MPI grid  
 Q - is the number of columns in the MPI grid  
 input - is the input filename (default HPL.dat)  
 frac - is the split-update fraction (important for hiding some MPI communication)`

The input file accepted by the  `rochpl`  executable follows the format below:
```
HPLinpack benchmark input file  
Innovative Computing Laboratory, University of Tennessee  

HPL.out output file name (if any)  
0 device out (6=stdout,7=stderr,file)  
1 # of problems sizes (N)  
45312 Ns  
1 # of NBs

```

### Performance Evaluation

The  **rocHPL**  benchmark is typically weak scaled so that the global matrix fills all available VRAM on all GPUs. The matrix size N is usually selected to be a multiple of the blocksize NB. Optimal parameters typically depend on the CPUs and GPUs of the system. Some example run lines for some AMD Instinct GPUs are the following:

#### MI100

1 GPU:  `mpirun_rochpl -P 1 -Q 1 -N 64000 --NB 512`  
2 GPU:  `mpirun_rochpl -P 1 -Q 2 -N 90112 --NB 512`  
4 GPU:  `mpirun_rochpl -P 2 -Q 2 -N 126976 --NB 512`  
8 GPU:  `mpirun_rochpl -P 2 -Q 4 -N 180224 --NB 512`

#### MI210/MI250/MI250X

1 GCD:  `mpirun_rochpl -P 1 -Q 1 -N 90112 --NB 512`  
2 GCD:  `mpirun_rochpl -P 2 -Q 1 -N 128000 --NB 512`  
4 GCD:  `mpirun_rochpl -P 2 -Q 2 -N 180224 --NB 512`  
8 GCD:  `mpirun_rochpl -P 2 -Q 4 -N 256000 --NB 512`  
16 GCD:  `mpirun_rochpl -P 4 -Q 4 -N 360448 --NB 512`

Note these are example command lines and optimal values may vary depending on system characteristics.

Overall performance of the benchmark is measured in 64-bit floating point operations (FLOPs) per second. Performance is reported at the end of the run to the user's specified output (by default the performance is printed to  **stdout**  and a results file  `HPL.out`).

### Testing rocHPL

At the end of each benchmark run, residual error checking is computed, and PASS or FAIL is printed to output.

The simplest suite of tests should run configurations from 1 to 4 GPUs to exercise different communication code paths. For example the tests should all report PASSED:
```
mpirun_rochpl -P 1 -Q 1 -N 43008  
mpirun_rochpl -P 1 -Q 2 -N 43008  
mpirun_rochpl -P 2 -Q 1 -N 43008  
mpirun_rochpl -P 2 -Q 2 -N 43008`
```
Please note that for successful testing, a device with at least 16GB of device memory is required


### Using Docker

#### Interactive

To run the benchmark interactively, use:

`sudo docker run --rm -it --device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined rochpl.6.0 /bin/bash`

Once you are in the interactive session, the benchmark may be run using the command  `mpirun_rochpl`  with your specific options. For example:

`mpirun_rochpl -P 1 -Q 1 -N 45312`

#### Non-Interactive

To run the benchmark non-interactively, use the  `mpirun_rochpl`  command as part of the command line. For example:

`sudo docker run --rm --device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined rochpl.6.0  mpirun_rochpl -P 1 -Q 1 -N 45312`

### Using Singularity

This section assumes that an up-to-date version of Singularity is installed on your system and properly configured for your system. Please consult with your system administrator or view official Singularity documentation.

Pull and convert the docker image to a singularity image format:

`singularity pull rochpl.sif docker://rochpl.6.0`

You can then use the information from the Running Application section to run a benchmark.

Launch a container:

`singularity run --pwd /tmp --writable-tmpfs rochpl.sif /bin/bash`

Then run the benchmark as desired. For example using a single GPU:

`mpirun_rochpl -P 1 -Q 1 -N 45312`
