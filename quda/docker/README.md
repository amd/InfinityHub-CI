# QUDA Docker Build Instructions 

## Overview
This document provides instructions on how to build QUDA into a Docker container that is portable between environments.

## Build System Requirements
- Git
- Docker

## Inputs
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command  

- ### IMAGE
    Default: `rocm_gpu:6.4`  
    > ***Note:***  
    >  This container needs to be build using [Base ROCm GPU](/base-gpu-mpi-rocm-docker/Dockerfile).

- ### QUDA_BRANCH
    Default: `develop`  
    Branch/Tag found: [QUDA repo](https://github.com/lattice/quda.git)

- ### QMP_BRANCH
    Default: `devel`  
    Branch/Tag found: [QMP repo](https://github.com/usqcd-software/qmp.git)

- ### QIO_BRANCH
    Default: `master`  
    Branch/Tag found: [QIO repo](https://github.com/usqcd-software/qio.git)   

## Building Container
Download the [Dockerfile](/quda/docker/Dockerfile)

To run the default configuration:
```
docker build -t mycontainer/quda -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
> Notes:  
>- `mycontainer` is an example container name.
>- the `.` at the end of the build line is important. It tells Docker where your build context is located.
>- `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context. If you are building in the same directory it is not required. 

To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized build-arg  
*DISCLAIMER:* This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Using a different base image or branch may result in build failures or poor performance.  
```
docker build \
    -t mycontainer/quda \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg IMAGE=rocm_gpu:6.4 \
    --build-arg QUDA_BRANCH=master \
    --build-arg QMP_BRANCH=master \
    --build-arg QIO_BRANCH=master \
    --build-arg QDPXX_BRANCH=master \
    . 
```

## Running an QUDA Container
Both Docker and Singularity can be run interactively or as a single command.

To run the [QUDA Benchmarks](/quda/README.md#running-quda-benchmarks), just replace the `<QUDA Command>` the examples in [Running QUDA Benchmarks](/quda/README.md#running-quda-benchmarks) section of the QUDA readme. The commands can be run directly in an interactive session as well. 

### Docker  
For access to the tuning files, please add `-v $(pwd):/tmp/` before `mycontainer/quda` in the following commands. This is the default location for the tuning files. To change this, add `--env QUDA_RESOURCE_PATH=/path/to/location/`
To run a single command docker, it will be necessary to mount the tuning files in for better performance. 

#### Docker Interactive
```
docker run --rm -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined mycontainer/quda /bin/bash
```
#### Docker Single Command
```
docker run --rm -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined mycontainer/quda <QUDA Command>
```

### Singularity  
For access to the tuning files, please add `--bind $(pwd):/tmp/` before `quda.sif` in the following commands. This is the default location for the tuning files. To change this, add `--env QUDA_RESOURCE_PATH=/path/to/location/`
To run a single command singularity, it will be necessary to mount the tuning files in for better performance. 

#### Build Singularity image from Docker
To build a Singularity image from the locally created docker file do the following:
```
singularity build quda.sif docker-daemon://mycontainer/quda:latest
```

#### Singularity Interactive
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity shell --no-home --writable-tmpfs --pwd /benchmark quda.sif
```

#### Singularity Single Command
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity run --no-home --writable-tmpfs --pwd /benchmark quda.sif <QUDA Command>
```
