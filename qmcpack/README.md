# QMCPACK


## Overview
[QMCPACK](https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack) is an open-source production-level many-body ab initio Quantum Monte Carlo code for computing the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, 2D nanomaterials and solids. The solid-state capabilities include metallic systems as well as insulators. QMCPACK is expected to run well on workstations through to the latest generation supercomputers. Besides high performance, particular emphasis is placed on code quality and reproducibility.

## Running QMCPACK Benchmark
There are several [examples](https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/tree/develop/examples) available within the QMCPACK repo.

This document will show how to run the CORAL-2 benchmark which is provided in this repo.

First untar the CORAL-2 benchmark
```
tar -xf coral_doe_fom.tar.gz
```
Navigate to the benchmark. 
```
cd /path/to/coral_doe_fom 
```
Copy/Link h5 file.  
This benchmark uses Hierarchical Data Format provided in qmc-data /path/to/qmc-data/NiO/NiO-fcc-supertwist111-supershift000-S64.h5 
(Data is pulled from https://anl.app.box.com/s/yxz1ic4kxtdtgpva5hcmlom9ixfl3v3c)
(More information about benchmarks can be found from https://github.com/QMCPACK/qmcpack/tree/develop/tests/performance/NiO)
```
ln -s /path/to/qmc-data/NiO/NiO-fcc-supertwist111-supershift000-S64.h5 .
```
> This has already been done within the example dockerfile provided. 

Execute  
```
/path/to/qmcpack/build/bin/qmcpack NiO-fcc-S64-dmc.xml
```
