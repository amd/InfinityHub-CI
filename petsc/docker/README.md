# PETSc Docker Build Instructions
Instructions on how to build a Docker Container with PETSc.

## System Requirements
- Git
- Docker

## Inputs:
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command    

- ### IMAGE
    Default: `rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04:5.4.2-complete`  
    Docker Tags found: 
    - [ROCm Ubuntu 22.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04)
    > Note:  
    > The `*-complete` version has all the components required for building and installation.  

- ### PETSc_BRANCH
    Default: default: `v3.19.0`  
    Branch/Tag found: [ PETSc repo](https://github.com/petsc/petsc.git).
    >NOTE:  
    >Initial HIP support was added in v3.18.0 with further optimizations included in minor releases. We recommend using v3.19 or newer for performance runs on AMD hardware

- ### UCX_BRANCH
    Default: `v1.14.1`  
    Branch/Tag found: [UXC repo](https://github.com/openucx/ucx)

- ### OMPI_BRANCH
    Default: `v4.1.5`  
    Branch/Tag found: [OpenMPI repo](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi)

## Building PETSc Container:
Download the all files at [PETSc Docker](/petsc/docker/)  

To run the default configuration:
```
docker build -t mycontainer/PETSc -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
>Notes:  
>- `mycontainer/PETSc` will be the name of your local container.
>- the `.` at the end of the build line is important! It tells Docker where your build context is located!
>- `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context, if you are building in the same directory it is not required. 
>- The `benchmark` directory is required within the build context directory, and the contents will be copied into the container. We have provided three benchmarks, and instructions on how to run them ([see below](#running-PETSc-container)). If you plan on running PETSc against your own data set, it can be copied into the container by placing it in the benchmark directory before building or mounted into the container using dockers mount/volume API. 



To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized build-arg  
*DISCLAIMER:* This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Using a different base image or branch may result in build failures or poor performance.
```
docker build \
    -t mycontainer/PETSc \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg IMAGE=rocm/dev-ubuntu-20.04:5.2.3-complete \
    --build-arg PETSc_BRANCH=v3.18.2 \
    --build-arg MPI_ENABLED=on \
    --build-arg UCX_BRANCH=master \
    --build-arg OMPI_BRANCH=main \
    . 
```


## Running PETSc Container
This section describes how to launch the containers. It is assumed that up-to-versions of Docker and/or Singularity is installed on your system.
If needed, please consult with your system administrator or view official documentation.

To run the [PETSc Benchmarks](/petsc/README.md#running-pets-benchmark), just replace the `<PETSc Command>` the examples in [Running PETSc Benchmarks](/petsc/README.md#running-pets-benchmark) section of the PETSc readme. The commands can be run directly in an interactive session as well. 

### Docker

#### Docker Interactive
To run the container and build the benchmark interactively 
``` 
docker run --rm -it \
    --device /dev/dri \
    --device /dev/kfd \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    -w /opt/petsc \
    mycontainer/PETSc  /bin/bash
```

#### Docker Single Command
To run the benchmark using docker with a single command
```
docker run --rm -it \
    --device /dev/dri \
    --device /dev/kfd \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    -w  /opt/petsc \
    mycontainer/PETSc  \
    <PETSc Command> 
```

### Singularity
This section assumes that an up-to-date version of Singularity is installed on your system and properly configured for your system. Please consult with your system administrator or view official Singularity documentation.
To build a Singularity container from your local Docker container, run the following command:
```
singularity build petsc.sif docker-daemon://mycontainer/PETSc
```


#### Singularity Interactive
To launch a Singularity image build into an interactive session
```
singularity shell \
    --no-home \
    --pwd /opt/petsc \
    --writable-tmpfs \
    petsc.sif \
    /bin/bash
```

#### Singularity Single Command
To launch a Singularity image with a single command, useful for batch scrips. 
```
singularity run \
    --no-home \
    --pwd /opt/petsc \
    --writable-tmpfs \
    petsc.sif \
    <PETSc Command>
```
