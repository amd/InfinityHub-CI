# NWChem

## Overview
NWChem is a chemistry application designed to handle a wide variety of scientific problems and simulation modes.  
It aims to provide its users with computational chemistry tools that are scalable both in their ability to treat large scientific computational chemistry problems efficiently, and in their use of available parallel computing resources from high-performance parallel supercomputers to conventional workstation clusters. 
## Single-Node Server Requirements

| CPUs | GPUs | Operating Systems | ROCm™ Driver | Container Runtimes | 
| ---- | ---- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | 
| X86_64 CPU(s) | AMD Instinct MI200 GPU(s) <br>  AMD Instinct MI100 GPU(s) <br> Radeon Instinct MI50(S) | Ubuntu 20.04 <BR> RHEL8 <br> | ROCm v5.x compatibility |[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) <br> [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/) | 

For ROCm installation procedures and validation checks, see:

## Running NWChem

### Pull Command
```
docker pull amdih/nwchem:7.0.2.amd1
```

### Docker 

#### Interactive 
```
docker run --rm -it \
    --device /dev/dri \
    --device /dev/kfd \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    -w /tmp \
    amdih/nwchem:7.0.2.amd1 /bin/bash
```

#### Single Command
```
docker run --rm -it \
    --device /dev/dri \ 
    --device /dev/kfd \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    -w /tmp \
    amdih/nwchem:7.0.2.amd1 <NWChem Command>
```

### Singularity

#### Build Singularity
```
singularity pull nwchem.sif docker://amdih/nwchem:7.0.2.amd1
```

#### Interactive 
```
singularity shell --no-home --writable-tmpfs ./nwchem.sif
```
#### Single Command
```
singularity run --no-home --writable-tmpfs ./nwchem.sif <NWChem Command>
```

### Running  Benchmark
There are 3 "water" benchmarks of NWChem i.e. **w3**, **w5** and **w7**.  
These benchmarks can be run with the `run-benchmark` script bundled in the `/opt/nwchem/` folder.

**Water w3**
```
run-benchmark w3 --ngpus #
```
**Water w5**
```
run-benchmark w5 --ngpus #
```
**Water w7**
```
run-benchmark w7 --ngpus #
```
> Replace the # with the number of GPUs to be used. 

To run any of the examples, use the following format: 
``` 
OMP_NUM_THREADS=8 mpirun --report-bindings -np 1 nwchem /opt/nwchem/gpu/water/w3/w3_1gpu.nw
```
