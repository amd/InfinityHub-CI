# Kokkos Docker Build
Instructions on how to build a Docker Container with Kokkos.  
This Kokkos Container is a platform for building HPC applications using Kokkos and HIP. 

## Build System Requirements
- Git
- Docker

## Inputs
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command  

- ### IMAGE
    Default: `rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04:6.0-complete`  
    Docker Tags found: 
    - [ROCm Ubuntu 22.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04)
    > Note:  
    > The `*-complete` version has all the components required for building and installation. 

- ### KOKKOS_BRANCH
    Default: `4.2.00`  
    Branch/Tag found: [Kokkos](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos.git).

- ### ENABLE_OPENMP
    Default: `OFF`  
    Options: `OFF` or `ON`
    If this option is set to off, UCX and Open MPI will not be installed, and the following two options will not be used.

## Building Kokkos Container
Download the [Dockerfile](/kokkos/docker/Dockerfile)  

To run the default configuration:
```
docker build -t mycontainer/kokkos -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
>Notes:  
>- `mycontainer/kokkos` is an example container name. 
>- the `.` at the end of the build line is important! It tells Docker where your build context is located!
>- `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context, if you are building in the same directory it is not required.

To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized build-arg  
*DISCLAIMER:* This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Using a different base image or branch may result in build failures or poor performance.
```
docker build \
    -t mycontainer/kokkos \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg IMAGE=rocm/dev-ubuntu-22.04:5.5-complete \
    --build-arg KOKKOS_BRANCH=3.7.02 \
    --build-arg ENABLE_OPENMP=ON
    . 
```

## Running Kokkos Container
This provides a clean environment to modify, build, and test any application that can utilized Kokkos or adding Kokkos to an existing project.

> Mount the project into the container  
> Directories/files mounted into the container will persist locally no work is lost.  
> To learn more about mounting directories and files into your container visit [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) and [Singularity Docs](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/bind_paths_and_mounts.html)


### Docker

#### Docker Interactive
```
docker run --rm -it \
    --device=/dev/kfd \
    --device=/dev/dri \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    -v /path/to/my/project:/mnt \
    mycontainer/kokkos \
    /bin/bash
```

### Singularity 

#### Build Singularity image from Docker
To build a Singularity image from the locally created docker file do the following:
```
singularity build kokkos.sif docker-daemon://mycontainer/kokkos:latest
```

#### Singularity Interactive
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity shell --no-home \
    --writable-tmpfs \
    --bind /path/to/my/project:/mnt \
    kokkos.sif
```
