Devito is a tool for performing optimised Finite Difference (FD) computation from high-level symbolic problem definitions. Devito performs automated code generation and Just-In-time (JIT) compilation based on symbolic equations defined in SymPy to create and execute highly optimised Finite Difference stencil kernels on multiple computer platforms.
