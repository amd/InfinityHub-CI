# PIConGPU

## Overview
The particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm is a central tool in plasma physics. It describes the dynamics of a plasma by computing the motion of electrons and ions in the plasma based on the Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations.
A description of the particle-in-cell algorithm is available in the [PIConGPU documentation](https://picongpu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/pic.html).
The [PIConGPU homepage](http://picongpu.hzdr.de/) also gives a high-level description of the innovations of this code.

## Single-Node Server Requirements
[System Requirements](/README.md#single-node-server-requirements) 

## Building Recipes
[Docker/Singularity Build](/picongpu/docker/)

## Running PIConGPU Benchmark
PIConGPU has many [benchmarks](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu/tree/dev/share/picongpu/benchmarks), [examples](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu/tree/dev/share/picongpu/examples), and [tests](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu/tree/dev/share/picongpu/tests).
Building each one is straight forward, see the [PIConGPU Dockerfile](/picongpu/docker/Dockerfile) for how this is done.  
The example here are from the Docker Build, KHI Growth Rate. 
>NOTE: After building any of the examples run `bin/picongpu --help` to get any additional parameters for the given example 

### Run KHI Growth Rate
From the directory where KHI has been build:

#### 1 GPU
```
mpirun -n 1 ./bin/picongpu -d 1 1 1 -g 128 128 128 --periodic 1 1 1 -s 1500 --fields_energy.period 20
```
