# AMD Base Container for GPU-Aware MPI with ROCm using MPICH Applications

## Overview
This container recipe is a 'boiler-plate' to building a container using ROCm and MPICH that is GPU-Aware MPI.  
The container is the base upon which all other applications are built.  

> **DISCLAIMER**  
> MITCH is API/ABI to compatible with CRAY MPICH, however there is no garantee that the version present on the system will be compatible with the version within the container.  
> The current recipes presented in the [InfinityHub-CI](https://github.com/AMD/InfinityHub-CI/) repo have been written with OpenMPI, and may require some modification to build/run with MIPCH.  

## Single-Node Server Requirements
[System Requirements](/README.md#single-node-server-requirements) 

## Docker Container Build
These instructions use Docker to create an HPC Application Container.  
If you are not familiar with creating Docker builds, please see the available [Docker manuals and references](https://docs.docker.com/).

## Build System Requirements
- Git
- Docker

## Updating the Dockerfile

### ROCm Installation Notes
The default container has ROCm and all of its libraries installed. Additional components may need to be installed depending on your application.
Environment variables for `PATH`, `LIBRARY_PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `C_INCLUDE_PATH`, and `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` for the base libraries of ROCm, OMPI and UCX.

> - The implementation of MPI on the node must match the implementation in the container for multi-node runs. 
> - To use OpenMP support add the following after the ROCm install:
>```
>env CC=$ROCM_PATH/bin/amdclang \
>    CXX=$ROCM_PATH/bin/amdclang++ \
>    FC=$ROCM_PATH/bin/amdflang
>```

### Application
Many Applications require components or applications that are not available using `apt-get`. These may be installed, per the applications installation instructions, at the section of the Docker file with the comment `# Install Additional Apps Below`. Add any binary, libraries, or include file paths to the appropriate environment variables similarly to the ROCm, UCX, and OpenMPI examples. After adding any additional applications add the desired application at the bottom of that section. 

There are a few ways to get additional applications into the container. 
- CURL/wget: download the binary/source and compile, using docker RUN command
- Source Control: Git is included; To uses a different SCM, add the desired SCM using `apt-get` as above. Clone your repo and build your application, using docker RUN command 
- The Docker COPY command: command to copy in files directory from the users local system.  

Please consult the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder) for details.


## Inputs
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command  

- ### ROCM_URL
    Default: `https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu-install/6.4/ubuntu/noble/amdgpu-install_6.4.60400-1_all.deb`
    - [AMDGPU-installer Directory](https://repo.radeon.com/amdgpu-install/)
    > ** Note ** 
    > The UBUNTU_VERSION below must match the same version of Ubuntu chosen for the amdgpu installer deb.
    > Each App has a recommended ROCm version. 

- ### UBUNTU_VERSION
    Default: `noble`  
    Docker Tags found: 
    - [Docker Ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu)
    > noble is currently recommended as many apps require newer versions of GNU tools than can be installed with `apt-get`. 

- ### MPICH_BRANCH
    Default: v4.3.0`  
    Branch/Tag found: [OpenMPI repo](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi)

- ### MPICH_DEVICE  
    Default: `ch4:ofi`  
    This is generally what is used for clusters build with Instinct GPUs, consult the cluster admin for additional info.  

- ### APT_GET_APPS
    Default:  `[BLANK]`  
    This allows a user to add additional applications and libraries through the apt-get interface in Ubuntu. Use a space separate list.   
    Example: `git vim nano` 


- ### AMDGPU_TARGETS
    Default: `gfx908,gfx90a,gfx942`  
    This variable is used to determine the GPU architecture. It is set as an environment variable that can used to pass into `--offload-arch` into your cmake compiler flags. 
    > |GPUs     | Architectures |
    > |---      |---            |
    > | MI100   | gfx908        |
    > | MI200   | gfx90a        |
    > | MI300   | gfx942        |

## Building Container
Download the [Dockerfile](/base-gpu-mpi-rocm-docker/Dockerfile)  

To run the default configuration:
```
docker build -t rocm_gpu:6.4 -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
> Notes:  
>- `rocm_gpu:6.4` is an example container name.
>- the `.` at the end of the build line is important. It tells Docker where your build context is located.
>- `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context. If you are building in the same directory it is not required. 

To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized build-arg parameters.   
*DISCLAIMER:* This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Using a different base image or branch may result in build failures or poor performance.  

```
docker build \
    -t rocm_gpu:6.4 \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg UBUNTU_VERSION=jammy \
    --build-arg MPICH_BRANCH=main \
    --build-arg APT_GET_APPS="vim nano git"
    . 
```

## Running an Application Container:
This section describes how to launch the containers. It is assumed that up-to-versions of Docker and/or Singularity is installed on your system.
If needed, please consult with your system administrator or view official documentation.

### Docker  
To run the container interactively, run the following command:
```
docker run --device=/dev/kfd \
           --device=/dev/dri \
           --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
           -it rocm_gpu:6.4 bash
```
> ** Notes **
> User running container user must have permissions to `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri`. This can be achieved by being a member of `video` and/or `render` group.  
> Additional Parameters
> - `-v [system-directory]/[container-directory]` will mount a directory into the container at run time.
> - `-w [container-directory]` will designate what directory within a container to start in. 

### Singularity  
Singularity, like Docker, can be used for running HPC containers.  
To create a Singularity container from your local Docker container, run the following command:
```
singularity build rocm_gpu.sif  docker-daemon://rocm_gpu:6.4
```

Singularity can be used similar to Docker to launch interactive and non-interactive containers, as shown in the following example of launching a interactive run
```
singularity shell --writable-tmpfs rocm_gpu.sif
```
> - `--writable-tmpfs` allows for the file system to be writable, many benchmarks/workloads require this.  
> - `--no-home` will *not* mount the users home directory into the container at run time. 
> - `--bind [system-directory]/[container-directory]` will mount a directory into the container  at run time. 
> - `--pwd [container-directory]` will designate what directory within a container to start in. 

*For more details on Singularity please see their [User Guide](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/)*

> **NOTES**  
> For running multi-node MPI enabled applications, it is required that the MPI implementation from the cluster is mounted into the container, along with any extra libraries that may be needed. When mounted in, these libraries should also be included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so the application can find them.  
> It is advised that Singularity be used as a part of an sbatch/srun (for slurm) for multi-node testing was well.
