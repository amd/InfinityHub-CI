## Installing CP2K using CP2K toolchain

1. Validate the Cluster/System has all of the above applications, with system path, library, and include environments set correctly. If you are unsure, the [Dockerfile](/cp2k/docker/Dockerfile) has examples of all useful configurations listed after the `ENV` commands. 
2. Clone the [CP2K GIT repo](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k.git) into your workspace. 
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k.git
```
3. Install CP2K dependencies with CP2Ks toolchains script.  
More Details for how the toolchain works visit [cp2k/tool/Toolchain](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/tree/master/tools/toolchain) the CP2K repo. A variable `GPU_VER` has been provided to set the GPU architecture to be built: `Mi50`, `Mi100`, `Mi250`. This specifies the GPU architecture for which DBCSR will be built. Mi250 is used for all MI200 series accelerators.
```bash
cd cp2k/tools/toolchain
./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh \
            -j8 \
            --install-all \
            --mpi-mode=openmpi \
            --math-mode=openblas \
            --gpu-ver=${GPU_VER} \
            --enable-hip \
            --with-gcc=system \
            --with-openmpi=system \
            --with-mkl=no \
            --with-acml=no \
            --with-ptscotch=no \
            --with-superlu=no \
            --with-pexsi=no \
            --with-quip=no \
            --with-plumed=no \
            --with-sirius=no \
            --with-gsl=no \
            --with-libvdwxc=no \
            --with-spglib=no \
            --with-hdf5=no \
            --with-spfft=no \
            --with-libvori=no \
            --with-libtorch=no \
            --with-elpa=no
```

4. Copy tool chain build files to `cp2k/arch`
```bash
cp cp2k/tools/toolchain/install/arch/* cp2k/arch/.
```

5. Tuning for build. (Optional)
CP2K will build without inclusion of these tuning flags, but it is recommended for performance to include these depending on what kind of Benchmark/Workload to be run. 

- RPA Benchmarks/Workloads:  
This executable has been built without the DBCSR GPU backend as it improves the performance of Random Phase Approximation (RPA) benchmarks.
```bash
echo "DFLAGS      = -D__LIBXSMM  -D__parallel -D__FFTW3  -D__LIBINT -D__LIBXC -D__SCALAPACK -D__COSMA -D__OFFLOAD_GEMM   -D__SPLA   -D__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__ -D__OFFLOAD_HIP" >> cp2k/arch/local_hip.psmp
```

- DFT Benchmarks/Workloads:  
This executable has been built without the PW GPU backend as it improves the performance of Linear Scaling Density Functional Theory 
```bash
echo "DFLAGS      = -D__LIBXSMM  -D__parallel -D__FFTW3  -D__LIBINT -D__LIBXC -D__SCALAPACK -D__COSMA -D__OFFLOAD_GEMM   -D__SPLA   -D__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__ -D__OFFLOAD_HIP -D__DBCSR_ACC -D__NO_OFFLOAD_PW" >> cp2k/arch/local_hip.psmp
```

6. Build CP2K
```bash
make realclean ARCH=local_hip VERSION=psmp
make -j (nproc) ARCH=local_hip VERSION=psmp
```

7. Add Binary to PATH
The binary gets build in `cp2k/exe/local_hip`
```BASH
ln -s /path/to/cp2k/exe/local_hip /path/to/cp2k/bin 
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cp2k/bin
```

8. Build other binary. (Optional)
You may want both the RPA and DFT tuned binary. 
You will want to update the binary name to be descriptive of the build. 
In the container they are `cp2k.psmp.no_dbcsr_gpu` and `cp2k.psmp.no_pw_gpu` to give a descriptive name to the two binaries.
The best way to achieve that is to repeat steps 4-6 using the other tuned options. 

9. Add affinity scripts that help tune at runtime. 
[Two affinity scripts](/cp2k/docker/scripts/) have been provided that will help tune the CPU/GPU usage at runtime.
Adding these scripts to the location with the binary(s) or any directory in the system's `PATH` will allow a user to take advantage of these scripts that have been provided and how to use them which is provided [Running CP2K Benchmark](/cp2k/README.md#running-cp2k-benchmarks).
