# RAJA Docker Build Instructions 

## Overview
This document provides instructions on how to build RAJA into a Docker container that is portable between environments.

## Build System Requirements
- Git
- Docker

## Inputs
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command  

- ### IMAGE
    Default: `rocm_gpu:6.2.4`  
    > ***Note:***  
    >  This container needs to be build using [Base ROCm GPU](/base-gpu-mpi-rocm-docker/Dockerfile).

- ### RAJA_BRANCH
    Default: `develop`  
    Branch/Tag found: [RAJA repo]( https://github.com/LLNL/raja.git)

- ### RAJAPERF_BRANCH
    Default: `devel`  
    Branch/Tag found: [RAJAPerf repo]( https://github.com/LLNL/rajaperf.git)
- ### ENABLE_OPENMP
    Default: `ON`  
    Enables OpenMP `ON` or `OFF`

- ### ENABLE_OMPI
    Default: `ON`  
    Enables MPI `ON` or `OFF`


## Building Container
Download the [Dockerfile](/RAJA/docker/Dockerfile)

To run the default configuration:
```
docker build -t mycontainer/raja -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
> Notes:  
>- `mycontainer` is an example container name.
>- the `.` at the end of the build line is important. It tells Docker where your build context is located.
>- `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context. If you are building in the same directory it is not required. 

To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized build-arg  
*DISCLAIMER:* This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Using a different base image or branch may result in build failures or poor performance.  
```
docker build \
    -t mycontainer/raja \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg IMAGE=rocm_gpu:6.2.4 \
    --build-arg RAJA_BRANCH=master \
    --build-arg RAJAPerf_BRANCH=master
    . 
```

## Running the RAJA Container
Both Docker and Singularity can be run interactively or as a single command.

To run the [RAJA Benchmarks](/raja/README.md#running-raja-benchmarks), just replace the `<RAJA Command>` the examples in [Running RAJA Benchmarks](/raja/README.md#running-raja-benchmarks) section of the RAJA readme. The commands can be run directly in an interactive session as well. To extract the CSVs generated by running the RAJAPerf benchmark, it is recommended you mount a directory from the host system into the container to save them for later. See the notes for [docker](/base-gpu-mpi-rocm-docker/README.md#docker) or [singularity](/base-gpu-mpi-rocm-docker/README.md#singularity) for details on how to do this. 

### Docker  
#### Docker Interactive
```
docker run --rm -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined mycontainer/raja /bin/bash
```
#### Docker Single Command
```
docker run --rm -it --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --security-opt seccomp=unconfined mycontainer/raja <RAJA Command>
```

### Singularity  
#### Build Singularity image from Docker
To build a Singularity image from the locally created docker file do the following:
```
singularity build raja.sif docker-daemon://mycontainer/raja:latest
```

#### Singularity Interactive
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity shell --no-home --writable-tmpfs raja.sif
```

#### Singularity Single Command
To launch a Singularity image build locally.
```
singularity run --no-home --writable-tmpfs raja.sif <RAJA Command>
```
