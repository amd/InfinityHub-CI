# MPAS
Instructions are provided to build Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), using the Cray Compiler on a HPE HPC environment. This document is a guide and requires modifications based on the users specific environment. No pre-built binaries or Docker type Containers are provided for MPAS.

## Overview

The Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) is a collaborative project for developing atmosphere, ocean, and other earth-system simulation components for use in climate, regional climate, and weather studies. The primary development partners are the climate modeling group at Los Alamos National Laboratory (COSIM) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Both primary partners are responsible for the MPAS framework, operators, and tools common to the applications; LANL has primary responsibility for the ocean model, and NCAR has primary responsibility for the atmospheric model.

The MPAS framework facilitates the rapid development and prototyping of models by providing infrastructure typically required by model developers, including high-level data types, communication routines, and I/O routines. By using MPAS, developers can leverage pre-existing code and focus more on development of their model.

    Location: [MPAS tar file](https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Model)  
    Branch: `master`

- ### HDF5
    Location: [HFD5 tar file](https://hdf-wordpress-1.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/manual/HDF5/HDF5_1_12_3/src/hdf5-1.12.3.tar.gz)

- ### NetFortran
    Location: [NetFortran](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran.git)  
    Branch: `v4.5.3`



### Building Application

----------

**Prerequisites:**

AMD GPU offloading is enabled only through the Cray ftn compiler (CCE 16) at this time. Appropriate modules must be loaded (e.g.,  `rocm/5.5.1`  and  `craype-accel-amd-gfx90a`).

The following libraries must be installed:  
- NETCDF  (V 4.8.0)
- PNETCDF  (V 1.12.2)
- HDF5 (V 1.12.3)
- ParallelIO ([https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO](https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO)  )

  
NETCDF, HDF5 and PNETCDF should already be provided on most HPE systems. If not, the user is responsible for providing standard builds with  `CC=cc`  and  `FC=ftn`.

To build ParallelIO, follow these instructions:
```
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO  
cd ParallelIO && mkdir build && cd build  
cmake .. CC=cc FC=ftn \  
-DNetCDF_C_PATH=/path/to/netcdf \  
-DNetCDF_Fortran_PATH=/path/to/netcdf \  
-DPnetCDF_PATH=/path/to/pnetcdf \  
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=… \  
-DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS=-ef  
make -j8 install
```
Minimum 2 GPUs (or 1 MI250/Mi250X GPU) required for this application. GPU-aware MPI is also required.

**Download MPAS-Model source code**

Obtain the MPAS-Model source code using the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/jychang48/MPAS-Model.git 
cd MPAS-Model  
git checkout atmosphere/develop-openacc-AMD-ftnpass
```


**Download JW Baroclinc Wave benchmark:**

Download and extract the tar file from here:  [**http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/projects/mpas/test_cases/v7.0/jw_baroclinic_wave.tar.gz**](http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/projects/mpas/test_cases/v7.0/jw_baroclinic_wave.tar.gz)

**Environment Variables:**  
Following environmental variables must be set for building MPAS:
```
NETCDF=/path/to/netcdf  
PNETCDF=/path/to/pnetcdf  
PIO=/path/to/ParallelIO  
USE_PIO2=true  
OPENMP_AMD_OFFLOAD=true
```
**Compiling init_atmosphere_model:**  
Execute the following make command inside MPAS-Model:
```
cd /path/to/MPAS-Model  
make CORE=init_atmosphere ftn-offload  
cp init_atmosphere_model /path/to/jw_baroclinic_wave
```
  
This will create a new binary called  `init_atmosphere_model`. Copy this binary into the benchmark directory:

`cp init_atmosphere_model /path/to/jw_baroclinic_wave`

**Compiling atmosphere_model:**  
Execute the following make command inside MPAS-Model:
```
make CORE=init_atmosphere clean  
make CORE=atmosphere ftn-offload
```
  
This will create a new binary called  `atmosphere_model`. Copy this binary into the benchmark directory:

`cp atmosphere_model /path/to/jw_baroclinic_wave`

**Preprocessing with init_atmosphere_model:**  
Execute the following make command inside  `/path/to/jw_baroclinic`:

`srun -n 1 ./init_atmosphere_model`

This will create a new filed called  `x1.40962.init.nc`  and only needs to be created once.

### Running The Application

----------

**2 GPUs/GCDs:**  
Set the following runtime environment variables:
```
AMD_DIRECT_DISPATCH=1  
ROC_ACTIVE_WAIT_TIMEOUT=0  
MPAS_DYNAMICS_RANKS_PER_NODE=2  
MPAS_RADIATION_RANKS_PER_NODE=2  
MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
```

Execute the following make command inside  `/path/to/jw_baroclinic_wave`:

`srun -n 4 ./atmosphere_model`

**4 GPUs/GCDs:**  
Set the following runtime environment variables:
```
AMD_DIRECT_DISPATCH=1  
ROC_ACTIVE_WAIT_TIMEOUT=0  
MPAS_DYNAMICS_RANKS_PER_NODE=4  
MPAS_RADIATION_RANKS_PER_NODE=2  
MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
```

Execute the following make command inside  `/path/to/jw_baroclinic_wave`:

`srun -n 6 ./atmosphere_model`

**8 GPUs/GCDs:**  
Set the following runtime environment variables:
```
AMD_DIRECT_DISPATCH=1  
ROC_ACTIVE_WAIT_TIMEOUT=0  
MPAS_DYNAMICS_RANKS_PER_NODE=8  
MPAS_RADIATION_RANKS_PER_NODE=2  
MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1
```

Execute the following make command inside  `/path/to/jw_baroclinic_wave`:

`srun -n 10 ./atmosphere_model`



### Troubleshooting

----------

  
If run successfully, you should have a log file called  `log.atmosphere.role01.0000.out`.
