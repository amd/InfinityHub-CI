## Overview
Use OpenMM as a library, or as an application. We include extensive language bindings for Python, C, C++, and even Fortran. The code is open source and actively maintained on GitHub, licensed under MIT and LGPL. Part of the Omnia suite of tools for predictive biomolecular simulation.

## Building Recipes
[Docker/Singularity Build](/openmm/docker/)
## Running OpenMM Benchmarks
Within the [OpenMM Repo](https://github.com/openmm/openmm.git) there are many examples provided:
`gbsa`, `rf`, `pme`, `amoebagk`, `amoebapme`, `apoa1rf`, `apoa1pme`, `apoa1ljpme`, `amber20-dhfr`.  

Each example can be run at `single`, `double`, or `mixed` precision. 

From the directory `<path/to>/openmm/examples/` these benchmark examples can be executed by the following, by substituting `$BENCHMARK_NAME` and `$PRECISION` for the desired combination. 
```
python3 benchmark.py --platform HIP --test $BENCHMARK_NAME --precision $PRECISION
```

To execute all of these benchmarks execute by creating a simple bash script with the following
```bash
benchmarks=(gbsa rf pme amoebagk amoebapme apoa1rf apoa1pme apoa1ljpme amber20-dhfr)
precisions=(single mixed double)
for benchmark in "${benchmarks[@]}"; do
    for precision in "${precisions[@]}"; do
        python3 benchmark.py --platform HIP --test $benchmark --precision $precision
    done
done
```

>NOTE: 
> The following message will be returned: `/bin/sh: 1: nvidia-smi: not found.` When running the benchmarks using `benchmark.py`, the benchmark script attempts to run `nvidia-smi` and will fail since this tool is not part of the ROCm runtime supporting AMD Instinct GPUs.  The output will include `nvidia-smi: not found` messages. This message can safely be ignored and there is no effect on the benchmark results.
