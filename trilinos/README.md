# Trilinos

## Overview
Trilinos is a portable toolkit for scientific computing developed at Sandia National Laboratory. Trilinos is built on top of the Kokkos portability layer, which means it has support for all manner of architectures using a MPI+X methodology where MPI handles communication between distributed memory spaces, and local compute can be handled using a variety of CPU/GPU parallelization APIs such as OpenMP, CUDA, and HIP, as well as experimental backends including HPX and SYCL, all of which is hidden under the Kokkos abstraction layer.

### Running Trilinos Benchmark
The benchmark provided in this container uses the MiniEM mini-app which is an unstructured electromagnetics solver built around an exact sequence discretization (edge/face basis functions) that uses Trilinos' algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioned conjugant gradient (CG) solver through MueLu. The default configuration defined by this container is to run a 25&times;25&times;25 hexahedral mesh over 100 time steps. The benchmark will report a figure-of-merit (FOM) in terms of the cell updates per second. The reported FOM will ignore initialization and setup time.

The benchmark can be found in the `/opt/trilinos/example/PanzerMiniEM/` directory. The executable `PanzerMiniEM_BlockPrec.exe` can be queried with `-h` for more information on the benchmark. The `maxwell.xml` file located in the executable directory contains various parameters that can be used to tune the benchmark.

The following command is an example of running the MiniEM benchmark in interactive mode (see: [docker build instructions](/trilinos/docker/README.md)):
```
cd /opt/trilinos/example/PanzerMiniEM/
mpirun -n <NumGPU> ./PanzerMiniEM_BlockPrec.exe --x-elements=25 --y-elements=25 --z-elements=25 --numTimeSteps=100 --workset-size=20000 --kokkos-map-device-id-by=mpi_rank
```
