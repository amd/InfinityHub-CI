# Siemens Star CCM+ Base Container

## Overview
This container recipe is a 'boiler-plate' for those with a license for Siemens Star CCM+. 
A user must have licenses and binaries to be able to use Siemens Star CCM+ within the container. 
> **NOTE**
> Using a Containerized version of Star CCM+ is not officially supported by Siemens.


## Single-Node Server Requirements
[System Requirements](/README.md#single-node-server-requirements) 

## Docker Container Build
These instructions use Docker to create a container for Siemens Star CCM+.
This container assumes that you have a license for Siemens Star CCM+ and a tarball with the Star CCM+ application provided by Siemens.
These files are expected to be in a directory named `sources` in the docker build context.  
This example, is using a tarball with the name `STAR-CCM+19.04.009_01_linux-x86_64-2.28_clang17.0.zip`.  
Do not download the tarball with 'gnu' in the name; this legacy build does not support AMD GPUs.  

If you are not familiar with creating Docker builds, please see the available [Docker manuals and references](https://docs.docker.com/).

## Build System Requirements
- Git
- Docker

## Updating the Dockerfile

### Input values
Within the dockerfile the default value for the Star CCM+ zip can be hard coded before building or input at build time.  
[Build Details](#building-container) can be found below.  

### Siemens License
There are a couple of licensing methods to use StarCCM+. Find details on your license within your [Siemens Support Center](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US) account.



## Inputs
Possible `build-arg` for the Docker build command  
- ### UBUNTU_VERSION
    Default: `jammy`  
    Docker Tags found: 
    - [Docker Ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu)
    > jammy is currently recommended as many apps require newer versions of GNU tools than can be installed with `apt-get`. 
- ### STAR_CCM_BINARY_ZIP
    Default: `STAR-CCM+19.04.009_01_linux-x86_64-2.28_clang17.0`
    > **NOTE:**
    > Leave off the `.zip` as this is used to extract and install Star CCM+
- ### STAR_CCM_VERSION
    Default: `19.04.009`
    > **NOTE:**  
    > This value is the numeric value after `STAR-CCM+` in the Binary ZIP name. 
    > This value is used to add StarCCM binaries to the container path. 
- ### CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE  
    - Address of the Siemens License server to acquire a license from.  
    - Formated like: `1999@<server-address>`
- ### LM_PROJECT
    - Power on Demand license obtained from Siemens Portal. 

> **Note**
> All of the License Options: `CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE` and `LM_PROJECT` can be set at run time using environment variables or when running Star CCM+ from a terminal.  
> Providing these values when creating a docker image will build them in. 
> Please find more documentation on setting up Licensing at [Siemens Support Center](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US).



## Building Container
Download the [Dockerfile](/siemens-star-ccm/Dockerfile)  

To run the default configuration:
```
docker build -t starccm:latest --build-arg CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE=1999@Localhost -f /path/to/Dockerfile . 
```
> Notes:  
>- `starccm:latest` is an example container name.
>- the `.` at the end of the build line is important. It tells Docker where your build context is located, the Siemens Star CCM+ files should be relative to this path. 
>- `-f /path/to/Dockerfile` is only required if your docker file is in a different directory than your build context. If you are building in the same directory it is not required. 

To run a custom configuration, include one or more customized build-arg parameters.   
*DISCLAIMER:* This Docker build has only been validated using the default values. Alterations may lead to failed builds if instructions are not followed.

```
docker build \
    -t Star CCM+:latest \
    -f /path/to/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg IMAGE=rocm_gpu:6.1.1 \
    --build-arg STAR_CCM_BINARY_ZIP="STAR-CCM+19.04.009_01_linux-aarch64-2.28_gnu11.4" \
    --build-arg CDLMD_LICENSE_FILE=1999@127.0.0.1 \
    --build-arg LM_PROJECT=123456789abc \
    . 
```

## Running an Application Container:
This section describes how to launch the containers. It is assumed that up-to-versions of Docker and/or Singularity is installed on your system.
If needed, please consult with your system administrator or view official documentation.

### Docker  
To run the container interactively, run the following command:
```
docker run -it \
    --device=/dev/kfd \
    --device=/dev/dri \
    --security-opt \
    seccomp=unconfined \
    -v /PATH/TO/TEST_FILES/:/benchmark \
    starccm:latest bash
```

> ** Notes **
> User running container user must have permissions to `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri`. This can be achieved by being a member of `video` and/or `render` group.  
> Additional Parameters
> - `-v [system-directory]:[container-directory]` will mount a directory into the container at run time.
> - To use HPE MPI or Cray MPI these Libraries/Binaries must be mounted into the container at run time. Find details for any additional configuration at the [Siemens Support Center](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US).
> - `-w [container-directory]` will designate what directory within a container to start in. 
> - `-e [ENV=Value]` will add an environment variable at runtime for a container, can be used to set or overwrite the license server or PoD key. 


### Singularity  
Singularity, like Docker, can be used for running HPC containers.  
To create a Singularity container from your local Docker container, run the following command:
```
singularity build starccm.sif  docker-daemon://starccm:latest
```

Singularity can be used similar to Docker to launch interactive and non-interactive containers, as shown in the following example of launching a interactive run
```
singularity shell --writable-tmpfs starccm.sif
```
> - `--writable-tmpfs` allows for the file system to be writable, many benchmarks/workloads require this.  
> - `--no-home` will *not* mount the users home directory into the container at run time. 
> - `--bind [system-directory]:[container-directory]` will mount a directory into the container  at run time. 
> - To use HPE MPI or Cray MPI these Libraries/Binaries must be mounted into the container at run time. Find details for any additional configuration at the [Siemens Support Center](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US).
> - `--pwd [container-directory]` will designate what directory within a container to start in. 
> - `--env [ENV=Value]` will add an environment variable at runtime for a container, can be used to set or overwrite the license server or PoD key. 



*For more details on Singularity please see their [User Guide](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/)*
